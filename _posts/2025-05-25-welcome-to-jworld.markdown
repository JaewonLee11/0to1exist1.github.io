Data science, life science, Dev, talks, and writes.  
I share Data science tutorials, AI tutorials, Dev tutorials.  
love music and outdoor activities.

This site is kind a playground for improving my CS. when i first learn computer science, i felt like meeting a new world because i have biological background and have no contact with Computer.  

Biology and Computer Science, there initiation was on the same level like finding in the real world. But in my feeling, biology development is like a sequence of discovering and proving the world, but Computer Science seems to have entered the realm of creation.

More creative, Rapid pace of development and possibility of combination with other major, its Magic!

I got a regret finding this out late..

So like a CS, i tried technology ASAP i can.
This is the Show Case of my world.

Let's talk, and have more insight!

Welcome!
